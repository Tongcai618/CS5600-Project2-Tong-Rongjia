## Project Objective
The Fitness Tracker Web App is a simple web-based application that allows users to register, log in, and track their daily workouts. Users can create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) workout records including sport type, duration, date, and a description. They could also get an exercise plan for their next 4 weeks based on Openai.

The application demonstrates a full-stack implementation using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and HTML5 with client-side rendering using vanilla JavaScript.

## Features
- User registration and login with authentication
- Add new workout records
- Edit and delete existing workouts
- Display all workouts in a responsive table
- Persistent storage using MongoDB
- Personalized 4-week fitness plan generation using **OpenAI API** based on user goal weight
- Fully deployed web application accessible via HTTPS
